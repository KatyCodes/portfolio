      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/KatyCodes/Resort2">Here</a> is a page for an exotic resort hotel.This is my first project using bootstrap, it's made up of some basic HTML, and I personalized it with some of my own CSS. It is a responsive website that will work on <em>all</em> devices.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/KatyCodes/cupcake-shop">Here</a> is a website that I built, this is just a basic HTML site with some CSS styling. I hope to add to later add more images and styling to this page.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/KatyCodes/pet-site">Here</a> you will find a very basic webpage that is coded using just HTML. It's a website about my dog Bella. She's the best.</li>
